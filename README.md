# How to Get Started with Docker Compose and Symfony

This was made by following this [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/get-started-docker-symfony) and you may find original repo [here](https://github.com/yemiwebby/symfony-docker-tut)

## Prerequisites

1. Previous experience with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), and [ORMs](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.8/reference/working-with-objects.html) \(specifically Doctrine).

2. You will also need to understand some basic terms associated with Docker (such as container, image, network, and service). Jeff Hale wrote a brilliant [series](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-enough-docker-to-be-useful-b7ba70caeb4b) that explains these terms. Feel free to go through it if any of these terms is unfamiliar.

3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) globally installed.

4. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

5. [The Symfony CLI tool](https://symfony.com/doc/current/cloud/getting-started.html#installing-the-cli-tool).
